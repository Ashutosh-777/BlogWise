HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.

ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.

(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING

MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.

POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA

ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL

BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.

ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING

CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,

- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN

DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,

INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE

SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND

HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL

RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.

ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.

(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING

MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.

POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA

ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL

BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.

ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING

CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,

- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN

DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,

INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE

SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND

HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL

RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.

ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.

(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING

MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.

POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA

ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL

BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.

ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING

CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,

- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN

DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,

INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE

SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND

HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL

RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.

ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.

(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING

MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.

POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA

ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL

BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.

ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING

CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,

- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN

DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,

INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE

SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND

HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL

RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.

ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.

(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING

MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.

POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA

ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL

BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.

ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING

CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,

- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN

DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.

DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,

INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE

SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND

HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL

RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.

ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.

(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
MANY RESEARCH BASED TOPICS ARE BULKY
ENOUGH TO BE WORKED ON FOR TWO YEARS OR
MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.
-BALBIR SINGH
SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING

MORE AS THERE'S ALWAYS SCOPE OF NEXT
VERSION OR COMPARISONS OR ACCURACY
IMPROVEMENTS. THIS IS BETTER SPECIFICALLY FOR
STUDENTS INTERESTED IN HIGHER STUDIES
SEARCHING FOR A STRONG ACADEMIC PROJECT.
HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE STILL EXPLORING DIFFERENT
FIELDS, THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE UP A
SMALLER PROBLEM STATEMENT AND WORK ON IT
FOR A SEMESTER OR TWO. IN THIS CASE
COMMITTING TO BTP IN THE THIRD YEAR ITSELF
MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST CHOICE.
I BELIEVE, BTECH THIRD YEAR IS ACADEMICALLY
AND PROFESSIONALLY VERY CRUCIAL AS WE ARE
ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOOLS
NECESSARY TO DEVELOP OUR SKILLS, HAVE AN
IDEA OF OUR CORE SUBJECTS AND CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WORK ON PROBLEM STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENTLY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO
CHOOSE BTP FROM THIRD YEAR. SO, I SPENT THE
FIFTH SEMESTER DOING ELECTRONICS CLUB
PROJECTS AND TOOK UP THE DEPARTMENTAL
DESIGN PROJECT IN THE SIXTH SEMESTER. THIS
HELPED TO DEVELOP A LEVEL OF VERSATILITY IN
SKILLS NEEDED FOR LATER PROJECTS.HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON YOUR BTP
TOPIC AND GUIDE?
RIGHT FROM MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, I DEVELOPED
AN INTEREST IN ELECTRONICS, MAINLY BECAUSE I
WAS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FASCINATING
WORLD OF 0S AND 1S THROUGH ELECTRONICS
CLUB, IITG. THROUGH TECHEVINCE'2017,
SAUMITRA SHARMA AND AAKHIL SHEIKH
INTRODUCED ME TO PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI, EEE
DEPT, IITG. I WAS SET ON WANTING TO PURSUE
VLSI AS MY RESEARCH FIELD AND CAREER -
SPECIFICALLY DIGITAL DESIGN. IN EEE DEPT.,
FPGA IS A POPULAR CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY TO
DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE VLSI CIRCUITS. I'VE
BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FPGA RELATED
RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM SOPHOMORE YEAR.
OVER THE SPAN OF MY INTERNSHIP AND
EXPOSURE TO VLSI, I DELVED INTO THE FIELD OF
HARDWARE SECURITY - AFTER ALL WHO DOES NOT
WANT TO BE A ‘HACKER’.

SO, AS A TOPIC FOR MY BTP, I DISCUSSED MY
FIELD OF INTEREST WITH PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS AN OPEN PROBLEM
STATEMENT IN ‘SOC DESIGN OF POST QUANTUM
CRYPTO PROCESSOR’.
DID YOU WORK SOLELY WITH YOUR BTP
GUIDE OR WITH A TEAM?
TEAMWORK IS MY GOTO MYNTRA. RIGHT AFTER
THE FIRST DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC, I WAS
CERTAIN THAT THIS TOPIC IS AN AMALGAMATION OF
THEORY (ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, THEORETICAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY) AND PRACTICAL VLSI (FPGA
DESIGN, ARM ARCHITECTURE).
TO DIPLOMATICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
WORKED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A GUIDE
WHILE BEING IN CONSTANT DISCUSSION WITH MY
TEAM - 2 UNDERGRADS (DESIGNING VLSI
CIRCUIT), AN MTECH STUDENT (MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS) AND 2 PHD STUDENTS (FORMULATING
AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT).
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR WORK IN
DETAIL?
"THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS", SAID ALADDIN,
BUT LET'S NOT GO THERE. OTHERWISE JUST LIKE
MOST OF OUR LECTURES, THINGS WILL START ROLLING
OFF THE CEILING.
LET ME BRIEFLY PROVIDE THE CORE IDEA OF OUR
PROJECT. "FANCY" TITLE: IMPLEMENTATION OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS ON
SOC.
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC (PQC)
ALGORITHM - BASICALLY AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME
THAT EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS CANNOT BREAK
THROUGH. (SORRY GOOGLE, IBM, CHINA XD). SO,
WE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A 'CRYPTO
PROCESSOR' ON ARM SOC BASED FPGA, WHICH
ENCRYPTS THE INPUT MESSAGES IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THE CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IS SECURE
AGAINST AN ATTACK BY A QUANTUM COMPUTER.
NOW, THE NATURAL QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK
HERE IS, "HOW CAN WE MAKE SOMETHING
(SYSTEMS) SECURE AGAINST SOMETHING
(QUANTUM COMPUTER) THAT IS NOT YET
DESIGNED?" THE ANSWER IS - WITH
MATHEMATICS! PQC ALGORITHMS ARE
MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE QUANTUM
SECURE, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY "SERIAL".
THE MAIN STEPS OF THE PROCESS WERE -
DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND HARDWARE-LEVEL
OPTIMIZATION OF ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
ALGORITHMS, AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT
DATA COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN
HOST MACHINE (MESSAGE SENDER, RECEIVER)
AND ARM SOC THROUGH AXI.
HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DID YOU HAVE
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ROLE IN THE
PROJECT?
ALL THANKS TO MY GUIDE PROF. GAURAV TRIVEDI,
PHD SUPERVISOR BIKRAM PAUL, AND MY BTP
PARTNER TARUN KUMAR YADAV, I HAD FULL
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING MY ROLE IN BTP. I STARTED
OFF BY DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD WHICH WAS
NECESSARY TO FUNCTIONALLY PLAN THE HARDWARE
IMPLEMENTATION. NEXT I WORKED ON SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION (PYTHON / SAGEMATH) FOR THE
PROOF OF CONCEPT. THEN, THE ACTUAL
HARDWARE SOC WAS DESIGNED ON FPGA
PRIMARILY IN VERILOG HDL AND SYSTEMC (FOR
ARM PROCESSOR SIDE MEMORY AND
REGISTER CONFIGURATION). YOUR ROLE AND
FLEXIBILITY REGARDING YOUR BTP WOULD
" THE
IS
IN THE
DEVIL
DETAILS

BTP IS NOW AN EXTRA CREDIT COURSE FOR
THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADS IN
THE EEE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU
ADVISE THEM TO OPT FOR IT?
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE
‘DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO’, BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT
I’M HERE FOR XD.
RATHER, I'LL POINT OUT HOW BTP MAKES
ENGINEERING MORE MEANINGFUL:
-JOURNEY FROM AN IDEA TO IMPLEMENTATION:
EVERY BTP STARTS FROM JUST A PROBLEM
STATEMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL PROJECT THAT HAS AN IMPACTFUL
EXISTENCE. THE JOURNEY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
IDEA TRANSFORMING INTO A PROJECT IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE.
- EXPLORING THE FIELD OF INTEREST: BTP
PROVIDES A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE
AND EXPLORE YOUR FIELD OF INTEREST THUS DRIVING
YOU ONE STEP FURTHER TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE
FIELD SPECIALIZATION.
-RESEARCH PUBLICATION: FOR SERIOUS BTP
PURSUERS, THE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PUBLISH A
GOOD JOURNAL/CONFERENCE PAPER. BTP
DOCUMENTATION SUFFICIENTLY FORMS A GOOD
BASE TO DEVELOP ON PRELIMINARY PAPER WRITING
AND SUBMIT A RESEARCH PAPER IN A RENOWNED
PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION.
- FOR THOSE WHO WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND SKILLS IN AN
INTERVIEW, NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN
DISCUSSING YOUR BTP.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND COMING
BATCHES TO UNDERTAKE BTP FROM THIRD
YEAR?
THIS IS VERY SUBJECTIVE AND MAINLY GOVERNED
BY THE SKILL LEVEL / INTEREST / CAREER
PREFERENCE OF THE DECISION MAKER.
OPTING FOR BTP IN THIRD YEAR MAINLY DEPENDS
ON THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND THE
DEDICATION / INTEREST OF THE CANDIDATE IN THE
FIELD. IF YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO CONTINUE
WORKING ON THE SAME PROBLEM STATEMENT FOR
ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ENGINEERING, AND THE
PROBLEM IS GOOD ENOUGH, THEN SURELY GO
AHEAD TAKE UP BTP FROM THIRD YEAR ITSELF.
